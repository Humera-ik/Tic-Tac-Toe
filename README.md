# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project made with JavaScript! This simple browser-based game lets two players play Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to place their mark (either X or O) on the grid, and the first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 will use the O mark and Player 2 will use the X mark.
Players take turns to click on the empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If the grid is filled and no player wins, the game is a draw.
